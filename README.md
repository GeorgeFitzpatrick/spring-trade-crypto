===================

I made this project for my coursework for my OCR A-Level in Computer Science.

I designed this project to automate the process of buying and selling cryptocurrencies to profit off of their volatility. The idea for this project was to eliminate the emotional and irrational behaviour presented by humans in manual trading and instead use technical analysis to make logical decisions. Automating this process also had the added benefit of computers making quicker decisions which opens up more opportunites to buy and sell and therefore more chances to take profit.
