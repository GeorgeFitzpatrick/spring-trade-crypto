===================

I designed this project to learn more about building dektop applications with JavaFX. I was interested to learn the basics of algorithmic trading so I've automated the process of buying and selling cryptocurrencies. The purpose of algorithmic trading is to eliminate the emotional and irrational behaviour presented by humans in manual trading and instead use technical analysis to make logical decisions. Automating this process also has the added benefit of computers making quicker decisions which opens up more opportunites to buy and sell for profit.
